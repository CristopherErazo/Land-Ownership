# Land Ownership

A data journalism project by SISSA and FACTA that investigates land ownership patterns in European countries and relates them to the distribution of farm subsidies. The analysis (at the moment) aggregates subsidy transactions by recipient and presents country-level summary statistics and inequality indicators (e.g., top share and Gini), alongside interactive maps and box plots for 2023 and 2024.
